    "## üß† Introduction\r\n",
    "Malaria remains a major public health burden across East Africa, particularly in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. These countries continue to experience significant morbidity and mortality due to the disease, especially among children and pregnant women. Accurate and timely prediction of malaria incidence can help governments and health organizations take proactive measures to prevent outbreaks and optimize resource allocation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast malaria incidence based on historical and environmental data from the three countries. The comparative study evaluates the performance of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to determine which best captures malaria patterns across the region.\r\n",

    "## üéØ Objectives\r\n",
    "- To build and compare predictive models of malaria incidence in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania using historical and climate-related data.\r\n",
    "- To identify the most accurate machine learning model for forecasting malaria trends.\r\n",
    "- To visualize model predictions over time and assess performance.\r\n",

    "## ‚ùó Problem Statement\r\n",
    "Malaria prediction models in East Africa are often limited in scope and accuracy. Health officials face challenges in anticipating outbreaks, which leads to delayed responses. There is a critical need for machine learning models that can accurately forecast malaria incidence across different East African countries using environmental and temporal data.\r\n",

    "This project successfully developed and compared machine learning models to predict malaria incidence across Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Among the models tested, Random Forest showed the best predictive power and trend-tracking capabilities. These insights can inform regional efforts in malaria control and support real-time decision-making through deployment in a user-friendly app.\r\n"
